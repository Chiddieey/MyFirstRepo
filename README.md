# MyFirstRepo

This is my first repository created as part of a GitHub learning task.

The purpose of this repository is to practice using Git and GitHub, including creating repositories, making commits, managing branches, resolving merge conflicts, and collaborating through pull requests.

Inside this repository, you will find:
- A README.md file explaining the project purpose.
- An introduction.txt file containing a brief introduction to the project.
- A goals.txt file listing my learning goals.
- A learning.txt file containing my course reflection.

This project helps me build my skills in version control and collaboration using GitHub.
